DEPLOYMENT GUIDE for EQAO Math Practice Test
=============================================

IMPORTANT: Only deploy the Streamlit app files. Do NOT use index.html.

Files needed for deployment:
- app.py (main application)
- question_generator.py (question logic)
- curriculum_strands.py (curriculum data)
- .streamlit/config.toml (configuration)
- pyproject.toml (dependencies)

Files to IGNORE during deployment:
- index.html (not needed - causes confusion)
- setup.sh (only for manual setup)
- README.md (documentation only)

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. Upload these files: app.py, question_generator.py, curriculum_strands.py, .streamlit/config.toml, pyproject.toml
2. Set your deployment command to: streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
3. Make sure your platform supports Python 3.11+ and can install streamlit

The app will automatically show a welcome screen with the "Start Practice Test" button when users visit your site.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If button doesn't work: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- If app won't start: Verify streamlit is installed and port 5000 is available
- If questions don't generate: Check that all Python files are uploaded correctly
